ðŸ§  Project: Interactive Neural Network Visualizer

This project is an interactive demo that visually explains a core concept in deep learning: how a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) solves non-linear classification problems. Using a slider, you can dynamically adjust the complexity of the neural network and instantly see how its decision boundary changes, providing a clear and engaging insight into how these models learn.

ðŸŽ¯ Functionalities & Key Features

Interactive Visualization: A user-friendly slider allows for real-time manipulation of the neural network's architecture.

Dynamic Decision Boundary: The plot automatically updates to show how the model's classification boundary adapts as the number of hidden neurons changes.

Non-linear Problem Solving: The demo uses the classic make_circles dataset to demonstrate why a simple linear model would fail and how an MLP can successfully classify complex, non-linear data.

Robust Code Structure: The project is built with clean, modular code, encapsulating the entire process of data generation, model training, and plotting within a single function.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack

Python: The foundational language for the entire project.

Scikit-learn: A powerful library used for building the MLPClassifier and generating the make_circles dataset.

NumPy: Essential for high-performance numerical operations and efficient data handling.

Matplotlib: The primary visualization library used to plot the data and the decision boundary.

ipywidgets: A crucial library for creating the interactive slider that drives the entire demo.

This demo goes beyond a basic script by providing an interactive learning tool, which showcases a deeper understanding of machine learning principles. It highlights several key skills:

Conceptual Understanding: Demonstrates a clear grasp of neural network architecture, activation functions (relu), and the importance of hidden layers in learning non-linear patterns.

Interactive Development: The use of ipywidgets proves my ability to create engaging, dynamic applications, not just static code. This is a valuable skill for building dashboards and proof-of-concept tools.

Data Visualization: The project effectively uses plots to communicate complex model behavior, a critical skill for explaining results to both technical and non-technical audiences.
